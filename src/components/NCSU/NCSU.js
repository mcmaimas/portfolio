            I was a TA for the CSC Department at NCSU for one semester in an
            introductory computer science course. It covered basic HTML/CSS and
            Linux terminal commands. I did it because it included being the
            lecturer and I love teaching. I also served 1 year on the Scholars
            Council for the university's Scholars Program.
