            I love being active such as playing soccer, golfing, hiking with my
            dog, playing basketball, biking, running with my dog, kayaking,
            climbing. My latest adventure was driving to Colorado (from NC) for
            2 weeks to go hiking.

            I love learning (shout out to Medium and Youtube), and am constantly
            trying to better myself. This isn't just tech, but all sorts of
            things. I've recently rediscovered my love for books. I just
            finished this Brilliant Darkness and am now reading Happy City.
