            I love being active, but only on certain occasions such as playing
            soccer, golfing, hiking with my dog, playing basketball, biking,
            running with my dog, swimming (a.k.a. floating in any body of
            water), kayaking, climbing, you get the idea...
          </h3>

            I love learning (shout out to Medium and Youtube), playing the
            occasional video game ( I don't play much, but when I do, I REALLY
            do) and reading. For some reason I love reading nonfiction stories
            about questionable people. ("Ghost in the Wire", "The Spider
            Network" and "Ugly Americans").
