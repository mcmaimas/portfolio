            Fonbnk digitizes prepaid mobile data(airtime). We provide users in
            developing countries the chance to purchase, store and use their
            airtime in new ways. We have partnered with NGO's to help distribute
            airtime in times of crisis, our primary use case was during Cyclone
            Idai.

            I use Node to build microservices to allow interaction with 3rd
            party applications. The 2 main applications I have helped integrate
            are Facebook Messenger and Flutterwave. Facebook Messenger gave us
            the abiligy to create a chatbot to handle the
            buying/selling/distribution of airtime. Flutterwave gave us the
            ability to accept payments in multiple African currencies. I also
            work on our React frontend as needed, but that is mainly viewed
            through webviews in Facebook Messenger.

            My next step is to help partner with a microtasking service (i.e.
            Appen) to become one of their default payout methods for their
            microtasking services.
