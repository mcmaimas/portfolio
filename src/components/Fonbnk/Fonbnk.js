            In many developing countries people rely on the use of prepaid SIM
            cards to connect to the internet. If someone buys airtime from
            Provider X they become tied to X. Fonbnk was created so users are
            not tied to a provider, rather they buy virtualized airtime from us
            to use at their discretion whether it is converting it into internet
            access, sending it to friends, or storing it for later use. We also
            have integrated our services with a Facebook Messenger Chatbot so
            users can access our application whenever they need without
            requiring them to download any extra application to get started.

            I am 1 of 3 developers who have turned this idea into a reality, and
            I do it all in my spare time. Mainly my work is spent
            building/deploying new services (Node.js/Google Cloud App Engine),
            and updating our front-end to incorporate these services
            (React.js/Firebase). At the time of writing we have ~7k users.
